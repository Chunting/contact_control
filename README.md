Contact Control package was initially written at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Later revisions were done at The University of Texas in the Nuclear Robotics Group. The software is open source, see License.txt.

Contact Control is used with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control forces at the end effector of a serial manipulator. For detailed information about its use, see my thesis at https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/39083. For information on how to interface with the package, see the doxygen documentation contained within this repo.
