Contact Control package was written at Los Alamos National Laboratory in support of robotic automation. The software is licensed by Los Alamos National Securty, LLC. See License.txt.

Contact Control is used with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control forces at the end effector of a serial manipulator. For detailed information about its use, see my thesis at https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/39083. For information on how to interface with the package, see the doxygen documentation contained within this repo.
